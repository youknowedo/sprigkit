# SprigKit

Renamed the old project to [sprig-vscode](https://github.com/youknowedo/sprig-vscode). Supposed to be a standalone app that works just like sprig-vscode but without vscode. Dont have time to document everything at the moment but the web project is supposed to be built and then used by the CLI.
